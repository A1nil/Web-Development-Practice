        <h1>About Manakamana Cable Car</h1>
        <p>Founded by Late Laxman Babu Shrestha, the Chitawon Co-E Group, a pioneer in the tourism and service industry,
            established the Mankamana Darshan (P) Ltd. The Manakamana Cable Car has changed the way people travel to
            Manakamana Temple, one of the most important Hindu Pilgrimage situated on top of a hill in Gorkha. The
            temple situated on the hilltop was made easily accessible to general public from Cheres, Icchakamana Rural
            Muncipality in Chitwan.<br>
            <br>
            The operation of the first ever Commercial Cable Car Service of Nepal began on November 24, 1998. The system
            installed is from the Doppelmayr Group who are known for their efficiency and performance. Resting on this
            caliber of ropeway technology, Manakamana Darshan, serves over a million pilgrims every year.
            <br>
            <br>
            Other than the regular business of providing rides to pilgrims, the Manakamana Darshan also volunteered its
            services to transport goods for the Manakamana village which was hit by the 2015 earthquake. We supported
            the transport of dry food, drinking water, tarpaulin, rice, medicine through the Laxman Babu Memorial Trust.
            We contribute 2% of our cable car ticket sales to the Manakamana Gaun Palika (1%) and Darechock Gaun Palika
            (1%), where the funds are utilized for local development programs. We are also involved in other CSR
            activities which are listed in the CSR section.
